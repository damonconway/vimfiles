Vim Files
=========

~/.vimrc is symlinked to vimrc

Most of my local configurations and simple ftdetect/plugin stuff is located in normal vim places, not as bundles.

Plugins
-------

The only plugin I really have installed in normal vim is pathogen, everything else is a bundle.

  * auto align blocks of text on arbitrary delimiters (useful for fat commas)
